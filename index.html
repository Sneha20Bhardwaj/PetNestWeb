        <p>Adopting a pet is not just about giving them a home; it is about giving them a second chance at life. These
          animals may have been abandoned, neglected, or simply born without a family, but when you welcome them into
          your world, you become their everything. They do not just find a place to live; they find love, trust, and a
          new purpose. In return, they give you unconditional love, loyalty, and companionship that words cannot fully
          describe. Together, you create a bond that heals both their wounds and yours, proving that every life, no
          matter how small, is worth saving.</p>

      <p class="conv2">Wondering how (and why) you should adopt?<br>
        Get the inside scoop.<br></p>
      <p class="conv3"><b>Why we recommend Adoption?</b><br>There are so many reasons to adopt: meeting a unique pet,
        spending less, doing a good deed—but let us talk facts. Millions of pets enter shelters every year. And hundreds
        of thousands are euthanized each year. We do not tell you that to guilt you or be a downer, but that is why
        adoption really matters to us. So we would love it if you considered adopting. And, since you're here, we are
        guessing you are. Seriously, no judgment if you find a pet another way (every pet parent journey is different!).
        But we are here to help make adoption easier, however we can.</p>
      <p class="conv4"><b>How to find a perfect PET?</b><br>Let us bust a myth. The perfect pet? Does not exist. Because
        there are so many pets that can be the right fit for you. It is just about knowing what you are looking for. So
        start by thinking about your criteria based on your lifestyle, breed preferences, living situation, (fur and
        human) family, etc. From there, our team can help match you with the right pet. Check out our New Pet Alerts
        too: with Alerts, we wll email you newly added adoptable pets that fit your search—so you can check out matches
        and meet your next best friend faster.</p>

      <h3>Why Should You Adopt a Dog or Cat?</h3>
      Did you know that over 2000 people per hour in India run a search right here looking to adopt a pet? Pet adoption
      is becoming the preferred way to find a new pet. Adoption will always be more convenient than buying a puppy for
      sale from a pet shop or finding a kitten for sale from a litter. Pet adoption brings less stress and more savings!
      So what are you waiting for? Go find that perfect pet for home!</p>
      <p class="q1">
      <h3>What is the fee to adopt a pet?</h3>
      No, there is no fee for pet adoption on ThePetNest. However, if you adopt from a different city pet owner/rescuer
      can ask for travel charges. In case if you find someone asking for charges you can write us at <a
        href="https://thepetnest.com/adopt-a-pet">support@thepetnest.com.</a></p>
      <p class="q1">
      <h3>How old do I need to be to adopt a pet?</h3>
      You need to be at least 18+ years old to adopt</p>
      <p class="q1">
      <h3>Can you return an adopted pet?</h3>
      We understand it can be hard to get an adjusted pet in the new home and vice versa, as long as your reason for
      returning is reasonable, you'll be welcome to put it up for adoption again</p>
